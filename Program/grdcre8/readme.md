Usage of grdcre8:
-----------------
1. The grid of node points for inversion is generated within the phase 
velocity inversion routines (**phaseVelInversion/**), but the routine 
**gridreg.f** allows you to do the same thing to test how the grid looks. 

2. An example input file **Cascadiagridinp.dat** is provided.
